# Advanced Creative Coding Final - Jeongin Yoon

#### For the final project, I created a gallery space where I can showcase my works in 360 degrees. There are functions that users can interact with the objects. Users can easily move around objects with a mouse click on the web. Also, users can place a red sphere on my nose on the portrait. My portrait is moving up and down. 

#### There is an animated 3D model (dancing) behind the camera as well.

#### What I tried to achieve was the physics engine. I tried to make the physics engine that users can either grab an object and throw it further or shoot the sphere to knock objects out on the ground. However, I was not able to make it work. I tried both Ammo.js and Cannon-es. I followed the official document examples on both, but it was not working as the official document example shows. It would've been much fun if I was able to implement the physics engine.
