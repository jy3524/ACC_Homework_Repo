# Advanced Creative Coding Final - Jeongin Yoon

#### For the final project, I created a gallery space where I can showcase some of my works in 360 degrees views. Users can move the first-person camera around with a, s, w, d keys or arrow keys. There are functions that users can interact with the objects. Users can move around objects with a mouse click on the web. Also, users can place a red sphere on the portrait of me.

#### There is an animated 3D model (dancing) behind the camera as well.

#### What I tried to implement in my project was gamified elements with the physics engine. I tried to build an environment where users can either grab an object and throw it or shoot the bullet(sphere) to knock objects out on the ground. However, I was not able to make it work. I tried both Ammo.js and Cannon-es. I followed the official document examples on both, but it was not working as the official document example shows. It would've been much fun if I was able to implement the physics engine.
