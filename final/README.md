# Advanced Creative Coding Final - Jeongin Yoon

#### For the final project, I created a gallery space where I can showcase some of my works in 360 degrees views. Users can move the first-person camera around with a, s, w, d keys, or arrow keys. 

#### Users can move objects from one place to another with a mouse drag. Also, users can place a red sphere on the portrait of me (e.g. on the nose).

#### There are some animations using gsap and 3D model animation (glb).

#### Used shader for one of the objects as well.

#### What I tried to implement in my project was gamified elements with the physics engine. I tried to build an environment where users can either grab an object and throw it or shoot the sphere to knock objects out on the ground. However, I was not able to make it work. I tried both Ammo.js and Cannon-es. I followed the official document examples on both, but it was not working as the official document example shows. It would've been much fun if I was able to make it work.
