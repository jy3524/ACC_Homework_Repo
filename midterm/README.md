# Advanced Creative Coding Midterm - Jeongin Yoon

##### For the midterm, I created a dog character that can interact with other shapes/sprites (collision detection function) and sprays colorful paint on the screen. Users can move the dog character with either mouse or keyboard ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right' and 'a', 's', 'w', 'd' keys). The shapes are moving from the left side to the right side of the screen. Users can use either keyboard or mouse to interfere with the shape's movement. If the character touches the shapes, shapes will stop on the spot. There are a total of 5 shape objects that a character can block. After blocking all the shapes, users can play with a character by clicking the mouse. Clicking the mouse sprays colorful paint on that spot of the screen. Users can spray paint as much as they want to create their own art form. Also, the size of the paint/art can be controlled by the 'datGUI' bar on the top right corner of the screen.

##### My initial idea was to make a very simple animated character that users can just interact with (similar to Super Mario but much simpler). However, creating just an animated character does not show any type of artwork, so I changed the plan. I added moving shapes and an art-creating function that users can interact with the screen and character.

##### What I can improve from this project is to connect the Arduino controller. It would be much fun to control the character with an Arduino. However, we just started learning about the device so I was not confident in implementing the Arduino device to this project. I will probably try to build something with Arduino and Three.js later this semester.
